      <h2>For Developers</h2>
      <p>Here is a high-level overview of some coding steps required:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          To add the Assistant in your own web-page, you will need to link to load our client.js file:

          <pre><code>{{ integrationSnippet }}</code></pre>

          <p>
            We can modify the core client.js file as needed to customize the chat features. You will need to add your
            AIFA tenant ID and may wish to set specific configuration options.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            To use the
            <strong>Form Support Agent</strong>
            , add
            <code>data-id</code>
            attributes to your form fields to help the assistant identify them more reliably. This is optional but
            recommended for better form-filling accuracy.
          </p>

          <p class="mt-2 text-[var(--bc-text)]">
            You will need a
            <strong>form definition</strong>
            and
            <strong>prompt templates</strong>
            to give context to AI about your webform. (See the
            <router-link :to="{ name: RouteNames.AI_FORM_ASSIST_DEMO }">demo</router-link>
            for code examples.)
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
